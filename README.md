In [object-oriented computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming"), **SOLID** is a [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic "Mnemonic")  [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and [maintainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance "Software maintenance"). It is not related to the [GRASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design) "GRASP (object-oriented design)") software design principles. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin "Robert C. Martin").

* [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/armanabkar/SOLID-Principles-Python/tree/master/1%20Single%20Responsibility%20Principle)
* [Open/Closed Principle](https://github.com/armanabkar/SOLID-Principles-Python/tree/master/2%20Open-Closed%20Principle)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/armanabkar/SOLID-Principles-Python/tree/master/3%20Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle)
* [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/armanabkar/SOLID-Principles-Python/tree/master/4%20Interface%20Segregation%20Principle)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/armanabkar/SOLID-Principles-Python/tree/master/5%20Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle)
